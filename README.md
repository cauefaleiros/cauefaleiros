# Hi, I'm a Backend Developer and Computer Enthusiast

Passionate about backend development and always eager to learn new things, constantly working to improve no matter how long it takes. Fascinated by programming theory, language design, and low-level programming. When not coding, I enjoy playing PokÃ©mon and MOBA titles, and I'm also a fan of fantasy and romantic comedy novels, as well as watching anime and reading manga. (ï½€ï½¥Ï‰ï½¥Â´)
