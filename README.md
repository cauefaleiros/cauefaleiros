# Hi, I'm a Backend Developer and Computer Enthusiast

I love backend development and learning new things.  
I'm always trying to get better, even if it takes time.  
I enjoy reading about programming theory, language design, and low-level programming.  

In my free time, I like to develop games and play PokÃ©mon and MOBA games.  
I also enjoy fantasy and romantic comedy novels.
